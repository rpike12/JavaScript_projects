# JavaScript_projects
The purpose of the following code is to create a new sqlite3 database, in javascript, that contains tables of PPR fantasy point projections,
average draft positions, and the resulting PPR fantasy points and positional rankings from the 2019 NFL season. Eventually, these tables will be
manipulated and used to examine, by position, the top over-performers and under-performers from the 2019 NFL season.
